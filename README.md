# CoinRace 💰🏃

Coin Race is a competitive 3D game of fighting and racing between two players. In the foreground
there are the two characters, the red player and the blue player. The action takes place
in a finite environment, bounded by the edges of a western movie-themed arena. 
As the duel between two gunmen of that period brought suspense and concentration into the atmosphere,
in the same landscape a fight is fought meant to stir up the same intense sensations. 

🟡 The goal is a clear one, to collect the coins faster than your opponent.
As in any other competition, orienteering skills and dexterity have their say in
the moment of such a race. The fastest certainly has an advantage in conquest
the title of winner, but the speed does not fully ensure a victory. 

🥊 Before the opponent having the advantage of reaching the limit number of coins collected, it can be
sabotaged or even decisively stopped by melee combat. This fact combines a cumulation of
skills in a strategy that can benefit anyone at any time, keeping the tension
and the hope of success in the soul of each.
